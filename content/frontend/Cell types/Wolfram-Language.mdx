An input cell is a multi-tool. By default, it assumes Wolfram Language as input if no other patterns are found in the first line:

<WLJSWrapper>
<span className="absolute -inset-1 bg-gradient-to-r from-fd-primary/50 to-purple-500/50 rounded-lg blur-xl opacity-5 group-hover:opacity-50 transition duration-500" />
<wljs-editor type="Input" display="codemirror">{`1+1`}</wljs-editor>
</WLJSWrapper>

<WLJSWrapper>
<wljs-editor type="Output" display="codemirror">{`2`}</wljs-editor>
</WLJSWrapper>

If an output is too large, it may be truncated or converted into a temporary symbol to reduce editor load. This can be adjusted in the editor's settings.

## Morph Output Cell into Input
If you modify a Wolfram Language __output cell__, it will automatically be converted into a new __input cell__.

## Auto-upload Files
Drag and drop files into the editor or paste media from the clipboard

## Syntax Highlighting & Symbol Tracking
Wolfram Language autocomplete and highlighting can be extended using external packages.

Once a symbol is defined in the `Global`` context of a Wolfram Kernel session, it appears in the autocomplete window and is shared across open notebooks.

At startup, the Wolfram Kernel loads all imported packages, reads `::usage` directives for defined symbols.

### Autocomplete for loaded packages
You can enable in the editor's settings to periodically check for new loaded packages (not user-defined symbols) info upon `Get` or `Needs` commands.

## Access to Documentation
Click the 🔎 icon in the autocomplete window to open the documentation for a symbol in a new tab.
