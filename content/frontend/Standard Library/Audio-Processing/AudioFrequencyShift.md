`AudioFrequencyShift[audio, freq]` gives audio by shifting the spectrum of audio by freq.

`AudioFrequencyShift[audio, freq, mix]` uses mix to control the ratio between the original and shifted audio.

## Examples

Shift audio frequency:

```wolfram
audio = AudioGenerator["Sin", 1];
AudioFrequencyShift[audio, 100]
```
